## About Me

My name is Pedro Azeredo Paix√£o and I'm a Software Engineer and an Entrepreneur. 

I always liked technology and I got a PC at a very early age. Since that moment I became addicted to computers. In my parents place the computer usage time was completly manipulated by me.

I am currently lead mobile software engineer at Infraspeak.

On the way I co-founded SIMI (https://www.getsimi.com) and LeanHub (https://www.lean-hub.com). In both SIMI and LeanHub I helped conceive, develop and implement the business as well as the product. Previously I did research work focused on text mining at SAPO Labs. Some projects in which I contributed: Verbetes and SemanticLists are still available online at SAPO. Of my earlier work I give focus to OntoExtract which gave origin to a book (available at Amazon).

Of my hobbies I'd say music related ones are favored. I play violin since I was 3 years old. I quite enjoy spending time with friends and take my part in a jam session.


I have an application to better present myself which you can download here, and see the source code here.
